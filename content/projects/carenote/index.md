My first team project was **CareNote**.

It was in intense journey to first come up
with a problem that has some meaning and is relevant to at least some people.
Then develop the actual solution that can solve *this real problem in the real
world*.

Before this I had always wrote small programs that only served me, mainly in configuring my development experience in Neovim, which is a small project in
itself maintained by me.

Here are some of the screenshots of the **prototype** which I with my teammates
designed.

I could not provide the screenshots of the actual application as I do not own a
Mac or an iPhone and the few screenshots I took that time have been lost
unfortunately.

But you can have a look at the source code if you want to dive deep,
[here](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/CareNote).

These are only the prototype screenshots, we were able to make similar UIs but
due being new to Swift and UIKit at that time it was a learning experience.
