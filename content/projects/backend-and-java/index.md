Java is the first language I started learning because of its verbosity and
acceptance.

I am working on some private projects that I plan to publish, and there are
some small projects that I have worked on lately. These are mostly for
educational purpose and do not try to solve any specific problem. I made them
just to have a learning experience.

These include really small programs that are simple command line
[games](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/Bingo) to simple spring boot
applications.

- [Spring Boot Project One](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/springBootProjectOne)
- [Ticket Booking Service](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/ticketBookingService)
- [Spring Web Server](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/webServerThreadPooled)
- [Spring Boot Proxies](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/springBootProxies)
- [Spring Boot Aspect Oriented Programming](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/springBootAOP)

These projects helped me get a grasp on principles like **Inversion of Control
(IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)**. And I am still building on that.

I had started learning Spring Boot some time ago and I am in the
process of making a hosted solution on a cloud service. I'll be posting about
all my projects here.

Apart from these little projects that I had prepared during my learning I also
prepare a repository of all the programming problems that I had solved
previously.

- [Problems](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/Problems)

This repository has over 180 problems that I had solved during my preparation.
Unfortunately, I no more update the repository and the problem set that I
solved is more that 250 now, as I really find it hard to maintain it
and I have found better tools for it.

I am currently learning about different designs and types of authentication
systems that I hopefully will use in my solutions. I was forced to learn about
**cryptography** (*hashing, encryption, MACs, and digital signatures*) when I
first encountered some implementations of authentication systems. I also
prepare notes as I go through these which are available [here](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/notes).
