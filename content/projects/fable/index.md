Fable is a Software as a Service (SaaS) Library Management System (LMS)
Software.

I worked on Fable as a part of an Internship at Infosys Limited,
Mysuru, which I received through a challenging selection process, I have a post
about it, [here]({{< relref "posts/got-selected" >}}).

Here are the videos of the actual developed applications.

### Development Background

The Fable project is subdivided into two application projects, one is for the
users and the other is only for library management and administrators. I worked
as the **backend architect** and **developer**.

I learned a lot from the project as this was my first project in which I worked
with a team of 10 members in an agile-based development process. I also had the
responsibility of the Scrum Master for the team.
