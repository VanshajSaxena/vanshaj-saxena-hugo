[Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) is a note-taking software used to
take structured notes, project and task management, time tracking, writing
typeset documents and more.

It uses `norg` file format, which is based on plain text format, and is easy to
use and read, still being very powerful. The `norg` file specification is
[open-source](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs) and anyone can build
and extend upon it. It is like a fusion of the simplicity of markdown with the
feature set of org-mode.

Because of this simplicity I have used it in the past to document by learnings
and embraced its task management features.

Although technically not a software, but it is something that I maintain
regularly. That's why I created this post.

My notes can be found [here](https://github.com/VanshajSaxena/notes).

These encompasses all the concepts that I don't
want to forget later. So I document them structurally. Neorg and Neovim both
gives tools to efficiently search and query through these notes.
