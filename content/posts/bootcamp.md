During the last week of December 2024, I signed up for a Bootcamp at my college designed to select students from the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) branch for a semester-long program.
This experience marked a new chapter in how I would spend my time in college. I was eager to learn new concepts and gain insights into industry standards.

The week-long Bootcamp was an intense assessment of my knowledge across various domains, and I genuinely enjoyed it.
Additionally, I made some friends during this time, and we still keep in touch today.
