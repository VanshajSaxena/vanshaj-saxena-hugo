## The Selection
On the day of January 29, 2024 I was selected for a semester wide program
powered by **Infosys** and **Apple** for iOS development.

The [Bootcamp]({{< relref "posts/bootcamp" >}}) was a tremendous experience.
Out of around 900 students, 100 students were selected.

This marked a new beginning for my full-day college schedule, which I had been
following for the past 2 years. What was about to come proved even challenging
than what I had anticipated.

## The Program
Earlier in the Bootcamp, I teamed up with a friend of mine as it was only
allowed to have two members in a team. But this time it was different. We were
instructed to form a team of four members, each with a different skill set.

I readily formed a team with the people I had met during the camp and we named
our team **SAVY**. _Each of our initial represented in the name of our team._

Our task was to design and develop an iOS application that could solve **at
least one real-world problem**, we were given 5 months to come up with our
solution.
