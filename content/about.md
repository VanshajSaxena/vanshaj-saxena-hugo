A Java developer, Systems Administrator, Linux enthusiast, and student, I am passionate about Linux and the open-source world, constantly exploring its boundaries and my own. I am a learner and a problem solver.

As a developer, I enjoy exploring different approaches to problem-solving, often creating and developing unconventional methods to tackle challenges.
